Monero is the leading cryptocurrency focused on
private and censorship-resistant transactions.

The majority of existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum,
have transparent blockchains. Transactions can be verified and/or traced
by anyone in the world. This means that the sending and receiving addresses
of these transactions could potentially be linked to real-world identities.

Monero, on the other hand, uses various privacy-enhancing technologies
to ensure the anonymity of its users.
