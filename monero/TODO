There is a problem when compiling Monero as a non-root user due to many files 
being opened during compilation.

LLVM ERROR: out of memory
c++: error: unable to execute command: Abort trap (core dumped)

You need to increase the data ulimit size to 2GB: ulimit -d 2000000

I don't know the hardware wallets work in OpenBSD so I haven't added the 
necessary dependencies to provide this functionality.
