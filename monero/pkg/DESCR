An open source command line interface (CLI) wallet for the Monero (XMR) digital 
currency, completely free to use and ideal for developers, intermediate and 
advanced users. The CLI wallet provides full control over your Monero node and 
funds, extensive customization options, and an HTTP RPC and ZMQ interface for 
seamless integration.

Key Features:

Local or Remote Node: Choose between running your own blockchain copy or 
connecting to a publicly available node.

Transactions via Tor/I2P: Enhance your privacy by routing transactions through 
Tor or I2P networks.

Bootstrap Node: Start using Monero right away with a remote node while your 
local blockchain syncs in the background, switching to it once fully 
synchronized.

RPC Wallet and Daemon: Both are included for easy setup and management.

Blockchain Pruning: Limited disk space? Prune the blockchain to download only a 
third of the data.

Pay-for-RPC: This new feature allows node operators to earn rewards when their 
node is used.
