An open-source command line interface (CLI) wallet developed by the Monero 
community, completely free to use, best suited for developers, intermediate, 
and advanced users. The CLI wallet gives you the total control over your Monero 
node and funds. Highly customizable and includes various analysis tools, as 
well as an HTTP RPC and 0MQ interface.

Features:

- Local or remote node. Use your own copy of the blockchain or a publicly 
available one.

- Transactions over Tor/I2P. For an additional layer of privacy.

- Bootstrap node. Use a remote node while downloading the blockchain locally, 
this will allow you to use Monero immediately and switch to your local node 
once it's completely synced.

- Compatible with hardware wallets such Trezor and Ledger.

- RPC Wallet and Daemon included in the port.

- Blockchain pruning. Not enough disk space? Just use pruning to download only 
1/3 of the blockchain.

- Pay-for-RPC. A new feature that allows node operators to get rewarded when 
their node is used.
