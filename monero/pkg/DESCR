Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. You 
are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers 
unless you allow them to do so.

Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and 
receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain 
(the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your 
purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain private by default.

Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, 
every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual 
wallets have a 25-word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once and can be 
written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files should be encrypted with a 
strong passphrase to ensure they are useless if ever stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a 
certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are 
not only untraceable but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures 
that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

Decentralization: The utility of Monero depends on its decentralised 
peer-to-peer consensus network - anyone should be able to run the monero 
software, validate the integrity of the blockchain, and participate in all 
aspects of the monero network using consumer-grade commodity hardware. 
Decentralization of the monero network is maintained by software development 
that minimizes the costs of running the monero software and inhibits the 
proliferation of specialized, non-commodity hardware.
