XD is a BitTorrent client written in Go that operates exclusively on the I2P 
network, ensuring no cross-network contamination and protecting the user's IP 
address from exposure. XD allows users to download and manage torrents using 
Magnet URIs and is compatible with both net/i2pd and net/i2p ports via the SAM 
API.
